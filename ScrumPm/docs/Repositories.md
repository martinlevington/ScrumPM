# Repositories

"*Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects*" (Martin Fowler).

Repositories, in practice, are used to perform database operations for domain objects (see [Entities](Entities.md), [AggregateRoots](AggregateRoots.md) ). Generally, a separated repository is used for each **aggregate root** or entity.
